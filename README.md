## Features

- Ultra-fast dev server and build via Vite + Bun
- Lightweight and minimal dependencies
- Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Sorted and grouped imports automatically
- Type-safe with TypeScript and additional text editor and IDE diagnostics via vite-plugin-checker

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsc7th/vite-react-ts-bun-starter.git
cd vite-react-ts-bun-starter
bun install
```

## Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Linting & Formatting

```bash
bun run format
```

## Build for Production

```bash
bun run build
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note for Neovim users:
If you‚Äôre using a text editor like Neovim and import alias resolution (e.g. @/components/...) isn‚Äôt working, make sure your TypeScript LSP (ts_ls) is correctly configured.

Update your LSP setup to explicitly register ts_ls with the proper filetypes and root directory detection:

```lua
tsserver = {
  filetypes = { "typescript", "typescriptreact", "javascript", "javascriptreact" },
  root_dir = require("lspconfig.util").root_pattern("tsconfig.json", "package.json", ".git"),
}
``` 

This ensures the language server correctly picks up your tsconfig.json paths and resolves aliases like @/ properly.
